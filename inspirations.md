* In this simulation game, the player builds a sprawling factory system. Raw ores are mined, then travel along conveyors to furnaces, which produce metals. Metals are conveyed to assembling machines, which combine them into different intermediate products (eg: copper -> copper wire, iron + copper wire -> electronic circuit). There are many dozens (perhaps hundreds) of intermediate and final products. The player gradually grows a sophisticated and complex factory system to produce them in the right volumes, at the right rates, directed to the right locations. The factory system is built up of primitives: conveyors, robot arms for loading/uploading, assembling machines.
* This is akin to VPLs in that you have a system of processes, with inputs and outputs and a notion of conveyance. You have transformations of "data" (metals, products). Playing the game involves design, development, and debugging. As you gain skill, you go through many cycles of design-pattern creation and improvement.
