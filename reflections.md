### [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](https://vimeo.com/64895205)
* A talk by [Bret Victor](worrydream.com) in which he demonstrates a prototype iPad app for interactively building animations, with an experience more akin to puppet theatre than traditional keyframe-and-curves computer animation.
* The app allows building algebraic relationships using geometric equivalents, a la Tristan Needham's book [Visual Complex Analysis](http://usf.usfca.edu/vca/) or the [GeoGebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGebra) project. This is at odds with most computer animation tools, where dynamic relationships between visual elements are expressed using algebraic equations of the elements' numeric attributes.
