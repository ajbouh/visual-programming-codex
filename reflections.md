* Paper: [A visual perception account of programming languages : finding the natural science in the art](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00737414) — "[A] true visual language would then be a graphical language that actually leverages the perceptual system" — Proposes using [Jacques Bertin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin)'s [Semiologie Graphique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sémiologie_graphique) as the lens through which to see programming language representation.

### [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](https://vimeo.com/64895205)
* A talk by [Bret Victor](worrydream.com) in which he demonstrates a prototype iPad app for interactively building animations, with an experience more akin to puppet theatre than traditional keyframe-and-curves computer animation.
* The app allows building algebraic relationships using geometric equivalents, a la Tristan Needham's book [Visual Complex Analysis](http://usf.usfca.edu/vca/) or the [GeoGebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGebra) project. This is at odds with most computer animation tools, where dynamic relationships between visual elements are expressed using algebraic equations of the elements' numeric attributes.
