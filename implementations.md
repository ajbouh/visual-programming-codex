### [Antimony](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/)
* "A computer-aided design (CAD) tool from a parallel universe in which CAD software evolved from Lisp machines rather than drafting tables"
* by [Matt Keeter](http://www.mattkeeter.com)


### [Apparatus](http://aprt.us)
* A hybrid graphics editor and programming environment for creating interactive diagrams, created by by [Toby Schachman](https://twitter.com/tobiaschneider).


### [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* Blender is an open-source 3D animation program with several visual programming tools.
* The [node editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/node_editor/introduction.html) allows you to create materials (shaders), texture maps, and compositing flows. They're also used for [rendering](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/cycles/nodes/introduction.html). These tools use the very familiar nodes-and-wires patching approach.
* The [logic editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/logic_editor.html) is used to set up game logic for Blender's built-in game engine. The interface seems like a slightly different take on patching, with a 3-step "sensor > controller > actuator" layout.

### Cornell Program Synthesizer
* Paper by Tim Teitelbaum and Thomas Reps: [The Cornell program synthesizer: a syntax-directed programming environment](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358755) — "Programs are not text; they are hierarchical compositions of computational structures and should be edited, executed, and debugged in an environment that consistently acknowledges and reinforces this viewpoint. The Cornell Program Synthesizer demands a structural perspective at all stages of program development. Its separate features are unified by a common foundation: a grammar for the programming language. Its full-screen derivation-tree editor and syntax-directed diagnostic interpreter combine to make the Synthesizer a powerful and responsive interactive programming tool."


### [DeepUI](https://deepui.io)

### Duangle Prototypes: Noodles, Conspire
* Prototypes created by Leonard Ritter of Duangle for their game Nowhere.
* Blog post: [Conspire: A Programming Environment for NOWHERE](http://blog.duangle.com/2015/01/conspire-programming-environment-for.html)
* Noodles includes a "compact" feature, which wraps selected node boxes into a new node, preserving connections.
* Conspire is a Lisp-like (so non-visual, but...), designed to be extended in terms of itself: "And then it hit me: what if the editor was built from the grounds up with Lispy principles: the simplest graphically based visualization possible, extensible from within the editor, so that the editor would factually become an editor-editor"

### [Pure Data](https://puredata.info)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data)
* An open source VPL for musicians and artists. Pure Data (Pd) is the prototypical example of a VPL — boxes that direct or transform flowing data, connected together with lines through which the data flows. Pd has distinctly-styled lines for messages (strings) and for signals (audio data), and type-specific "objects" (boxes) like `sin` for messages and `sin~` for signals.
* The help and tutorial documents are implemented as Pd patches, and you are encouraged to edit them.

* [Befunge](http://catseye.tc/article/Languages.md#befunge-93)
    * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge): "Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid."
    * [GIF](https://twitter.com/algoritmic/status/988137596638425089) of Befunge code being interpreted


* [Cvlemar](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Cvlemar) — "A program is a map of lines connected to nodes. It does steps by sending each input node to all lines from that node, and sends output to the output nodes. If more than one number sending to a output node, all are added together."
