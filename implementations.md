### Duangle Prototypes: Noodles, Conspire
* Prototypes created by Leonard Ritter of Duangle for their game Nowhere.
* Blog post: [Conspire: A Programming Environment for NOWHERE](http://blog.duangle.com/2015/01/conspire-programming-environment-for.html)
* Noodles includes a "compact" feature, which wraps selected node boxes into a new node, preserving connections.
* Conspire is a Lisp-like (so non-visual, but...), designed to be extended in terms of itself: "And then it hit me: what if the editor was built from the grounds up with Lispy principles: the simplest graphically based visualization possible, extensible from within the editor, so that the editor would factually become an editor-editor"

### [Pure Data](https://puredata.info)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data)
* An open source VPL for musicians and artists. Pure Data (Pd) is the prototypical example of a VPL — boxes that direct or transform flowing data, connected together with lines through which the data flows. Pd has distinctly-styled lines for messages (strings) and for signals (audio data), and type-specific "objects" (boxes) like `sin` for messages and `sin~` for signals.
* The help and tutorial documents are implemented as Pd patches, and you are encouraged to edit them.


### [Quartz Composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer)
* A tool from Apple for creating animations and prototypes, leveraging technologies in macOS like CoreImage.

### Scratch
* A VPL designed mainly for children. Scratch is a text-centric language that you assemble using blocks that snap together, with the syntax rules enforced by the shape of the blocks. Color is used to indicate a block's type of data or behaviour.
