# Visual Programming Codex

Despite the GUI going mainstream in the 80s, the programming community has largely opted to remain in the era of the terminal. Still, there have always been magnificent visual programming projects at the periphery. This repo exists to shine a light on these alternatives, to ask what costs and benefits they offer, and reflect on the work of people pushing for a future where programming leverages more of our senses and modalities.

1. [Implementations](implementations.md) — Specific products, projects, or prototypes.
1. [Inspirations](inspirations.md) — Visual systems for things that only loosely resemble programming.
1. [Reflections](reflections.md) — Talks, articles, papers, and links broadly about non-textual programming.

This is a work-in-progress, inspired by Shaun Lebron's [History of Lisp Parens](https://github.com/shaunlebron/history-of-lisp-parens). It's small right now, but should grow and gain structure and substances with time. If you know of anything that could or should be added, please open an issue.
