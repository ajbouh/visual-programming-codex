# Visual Programming

There has always been a simmering interest in non-textual forms of programming. Despite the GUI going mainstream in the 80s, the programming community has largely opted to remain in the era of the terminal. Let's try to figure out why that is, what costs and benefits there are to visual languages, and look at the work of people pushing for a future where programming leverages more of our senses and modalities.

Throughout this repo, the acronym VPL stands for "Visual Programming Language".

1. [Reflections](reflections.md) — Talks, articles, papers, and links broadly about non-textual programming.
